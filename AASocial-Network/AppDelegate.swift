//  FB INTEGRATION: (1) Create a new project in xCode and Firebase
//                  (2) At developers.facebook.com, create a new app, enter xCode project display name and bundle ID,
//                      & create a new product (FB login).  Click yes for 'Client OAuth Login' option
//                  (3) Enter the FB App ID & App Secret in the Firebase/Login&Auth/FB screen
//                  (4) Download the FB SDK, and then copy the Bolts, CoreKit, and LoginKit into your xCode project
//                  (5) To use Firebase: 'Pod Init', enter "pod 'Firebase', '2.3.3'", then 'Pod Install'
//                  (6) Open Info.plist as source code
//                  (7) Copy the following keys in Info.plist: LSApplicationQueriesSchemes, NSAppTransportSecurity, & CFBundleURLTypes
//                  (8) In the project build settings, change Bitcode setting to 'No'
//                  (9) In AppDelegate.swift, import FBSDKCoreKit and FBSDKLoginKit
//                  (10) In didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, send data to FB to see if user is already logged in by entering:
//                      'return FBSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)'
//                  (11) In didBecomeActive, reactivate FB if needed by entering 'FBSDKAppEvents.activateApp()'
//                  (12) Create a new function to pass the application, url, etc to FB: func application
//                      (application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {}
//                  (13) In the VC, import FBSDKCoreKit/FBSDKLonginKit and create IBAction with appropriate code
//                  Useful Video: Part 4
//                  Useful Websites: https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/login/facebook.html
